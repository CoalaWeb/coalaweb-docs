### <a name="plg-facebookjs"></a>System - Facebook JS

**CoalaWeb Facebook JS** loads the Facebook SDK making sure it has only be loaded once and only where it is needed. It works in conjunction with the System - CW Gears plugin storing each page's URL with information on whether Facebook should be loaded or not. The CoalaWeb Social Links and Comments extensions depend on it for the correct functioning of Facebook related options. *\[Figure 1\]*
