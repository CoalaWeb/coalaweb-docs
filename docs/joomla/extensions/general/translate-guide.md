##The Official Way to Translate a CoalaWeb extension

### Where are the languages files stored?

All our language packs are created through the powerful online translation environment Transifex. The first thing you you will have to do if you want contribute is create a free account over at Transifex. If you haven't already got one, head over to the [Transifex Signup](https://www.transifex.com/signup) page and get started.

### Who manages the translation process?

The management of our language packs has been handed over to the fantastic Joomla translation group known as the [OpenTranslators](http://opentranslators.org/).

OpenTranslators takes care of the translation teams which are grouped by language and that ultimately do the translations. By joining an OpenTranslators managed team you not only get access to CoalaWeb extensions but a huge list of Joomla extensions entrusted to the OpenTranslators and the list is growing all the time.

So to get started on translating a CoalaWeb extensions into your language, you will need to [request to join](https://opentranslators.transifex.com/organization/opentranslators/dashboard/coalaweb-contact) a language team managed by OpenTranslators. The process of requesting to join a team can take some time so please be patinet but if you don't get an answer for an extend perido of time just let me know and I will do some inquires.

### What in it for me?

If you completely translate all the language files for a CoalaWeb extension that includes a **Pro** version I'll send you a copy of the Pro version for free. When I release an update if you translate the newly added language strings I will also send you a copy of the Pro version.

For the CoalaWeb Core extensions you obviously get a language pack in your language to use on your site and also a warm fuzzy feeling for helping out the community.
