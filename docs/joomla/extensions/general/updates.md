## <a class="doc-top" name="com-updates"></a>Component Updates

This section covers CoalaWeb extension that come packaged with a central component.

CoalaWeb extensions integrate with the inbuilt **Joomla Update** system so both **Core** and **Pro** users can keep their extensions up to date. For **Core** users when you see updates listed in the Joomla update manager feel free to select it and update from within Joomla. 

For **Pro** subscribers you will need to make sure you still have a valid subscription and that you have entered your **Download ID** in either the **Control Panel** input field. *\[Figure-28\]*

Inside the **CW Gears** plugin options your will find a tab titled **Updates** and under it a **Download ID** input field. I recommend you copy and paste your **Download ID** into this field to reduce the risk of a typo.  *\[Figure-11a\]*
