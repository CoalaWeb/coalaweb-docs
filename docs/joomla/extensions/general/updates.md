## <a class="doc-top" name="com-updates"></a>Component Updates

<div class="uk-alert">This section covers CoalaWeb extensions that come packaged with a central component.</div>

CoalaWeb component based extensions integrate with the inbuilt **Joomla Update** system so both **Core** and **Pro** users can keep their extensions up to date. For **Core** users when you see updates listed in the Joomla update manager feel free to select it and update. 

For **Pro** subscribers you will need to make sure you still have a **Valid Subscription** and that you have entered your **Download ID** in either the **Control Panel** input field. *\[Figure-1\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Not sure where to find your Download ID? Click <a href="#options-downloadid">HERE</a> for more info.</div>

## <a name="non-com-updates"></a>Non Component Updates

<div class="uk-alert">This section covers CoalaWeb extensions that don't come packaged with a central component such as stand alone modules and plugins.</div>

CoalaWeb non component based extensions integrate with the inbuilt **Joomla Update** system so both **Core** and **Pro** users can keep their extension up to date. For **Core** users when you see updates listed in the Joomla update manager feel free to select it and update. 

For **Pro** subscribers you will need to make sure you still have a **Valid Subscription** and that you have entered your **Download ID** into the **System - CW Gears** plugin. *\[Figure-3\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Not sure where to find your Download ID? Click <a href="#options-downloadid">HERE</a> for more info.</div>

Inside the **CW Gears** plugin options your will find a tab titled **Updates** and under it a **Download ID** input field. I recommend you copy and paste your **Download ID** into this field to reduce the risk of a typo.  *\[Figure-4\]*

<div class="uk-alert">The CW Gears plugin will take care of the Download ID for any CoalaWeb extensions that doesn't come with a component.</div>

## <a name="dl-id"></a> Where can I find my Download ID?

To see your **Download ID** you will need to log into [coalaweb.com](http://coalaweb.com) and then go to:

    Members -> My Subscriptions

You will then see the ID displayed in the module titled **Download ID**. *\[Figure-5\]*
