<div class="uk-alert">Not everyone has or wants a PayPal account which is fine but that doesn't mean that you cant pay with your Debit/Credit card using PayPal checkout.</div>

### Step 1
Below is the standard PayPal check out window but one thing you may have missed is that if you want to pay with your credit/debit card, without signing up to PayPal you can click the **Pay with Debit or Credit Card** button down the bottom of the form.  This will trigger what is known as the **PayPal Guest Checkout** *\[Figure 1\]*

### Step 2
Now, you are presented with the **PayPal Guest Checkout** form that requires information about your credit or debit card. Depending on your country, you may also be prompted for your billing address, email address, or phone number. To continue after entering all the necessary information, simply click on **Pay now** button at the bottom of the form. *\[Figure 2\]*
                                                                                                               <a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/paypal/no-paypal-account-f2.png ">![Figure-2](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/paypal/no-paypal-account-f2.png "Figure-2"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

### Step 3
Afterwards, you will be asked whether you want to create a PayPal account. If you decide to do so, you can register with the information you previously entered. If you don't want or need a PayPal account for what ever reason you can of course decline their offer.

#### <a name="q1"></a>I wasn't offered the option to **Pay with Debit or Credit Card**?

If the option wasn't not offered to you it may be that your country doesn't support this kind of payment. Unfortunately this is out side of our control but it may help to clear your browsing data and cookies in case the system has made a mistake about your location.

#### <a name="q2"></a>PayPal isn't accepting my card?

If PayPal is not accepting your credit card, it may also be that you already have a PayPal account that is linked to that particular card, preventing the site to pay with it without logging in.
