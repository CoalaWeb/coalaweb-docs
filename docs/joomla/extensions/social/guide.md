## <a class="doc-top" name="overview"></a>Overview

**CoalaWeb Social Links** is a complete social media package to help your site visitors share content, follow you through a variety of social networks and vote for particular content with social buttons. There are two versions available a Core (Free) and Pro (Paid Subscription) version that comes with extend functionality.

<div class="uk-alert">When installing all the parts of the system will be installed at the same time making installing, upgrading and uninstalling a breeze.</div>

## <a name="component-guide"></a>Component

### <a name="control-panel"></a>Control Panel

The **Control Panel** as seen below it is designed to be an easy starting point, think of it as the components head quarters. While carrying out tasks you can easily jump from the **Control Panel** to the different sections and then return before moving onto the next one. *\[Figure-1\]*

![Figure-1](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-cpanel.png "Figure-1"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="com-counts"></a>Counts

![Figure-31](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-counts1.png "Figure-31"){.coalaweb-docs}

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>Counts</em> information into two parts.</div>

#### Counts \[List\]

If you have chosen to turn on share counts in the component options then you will start to see the **Counts** list view fill up with your pages and their related social counts. This will vary based on what social networks you have chosen to count and each count will be displayed in its own column. *\[Figure-31a\]*

**Columns Name Reference**

-   FC = Facebook Comments
-   FL = Facebook Likes
-   FS = Facebook Share
-   FT = Facebook Total
-   G = Google +
-   L = Linkedin
-   P = Pinterest
-   R = Reddit
-   S = Stumbleupon

![Figure-31a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-counts2.png "Figure-31a"){.coalaweb-docs}

If you are familiar with the latest versions of Joomla you will already know what features are avaliable in the **Counts** view and how to use them but if your not read on to get a brief summary.

In the **Counts** view you can filter by any column and search by title and published state. From this view you can also change an items published state by using an individual items **Status** button or multiple items by selecting them and using the buttons at the top. You can also directly delete an item rather than send it to the **Trash** by hovering over it's name and using the drop down selector. 

One last cool feature is the **Magnifying Glass** next to an item's name which provides a quick way to see the exact page **URL** that the counts relate too. *\[Figure-31b\]*

![Figure-31b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-counts3.png "Figure-31b"){.coalaweb-docs}

One thing to note is if you send items to the **Trash** remember to **Empty Trash** to stop them from interfering with new counts. You can do this by clicking the **Search Tools** button and then filtering by **Trashed** in the drop down selector. Next select all the items and click the **Empty Trash** button from the top. *\[Figure-31c\]*

![Figure-31c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-counts4.png "Figure-31c"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Count \[Edit\]

To edit an item you can click on it's **Linked Title** or select it and then click the **Edit** button from the top or hover over the title and the use the drop down and select **Edit**.

Once in the edit screen you can see all the information related to a particular URL including it's **Individual Counts**, **Time**, **URL** and **Title**. You can give it an **Alias** which will make identifying it in the list view much easier or let the system add one when you save the item. 

You can also make changes to the counts but keep in mind that any changes you make will get updated when the **Locktime** has elapsed. You can also change an items **Status** and check or update the last person that **Modified** the item and the time it was modified. *\[Figure-31d\]*

![Figure-31d](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-counts5.png "Figure-31d"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="com-purge"></a>Purge \[Pro\]

![Figure-32a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-purge1.png "Figure-32a"){.coalaweb-docs}

Pro subscribers also get a **Purge** button will delete all of the count records current stored in the Social Links database tables. To make sure you haven't accidentally press it you will get a popup asking you to confirm your choice. *\[Figure-32b\]*

![Figure-32b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-purge2.png "Figure-32b"){.coalaweb-docs}

After it has completed you get a confirmation message or an error message if it was unable to carry out the task. *\[Figure-32c\]*

![Figure-32c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-purge3.png "Figure-32c"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="com-optimize"></a>Optimize and Repair \[Pro\]

![Figure-33a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-optimize1.png "Figure-33a"){.coalaweb-docs}

Pro subscribers also get an **Optimize** button will attempt to repair and optimize all the Social Links database tables. To make sure you haven't accidentally press it you will get a popup asking you to confirm your choice. *\[Figure-33b\]*

![Figure-33b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-optimize2.png "Figure-33b"){.coalaweb-docs}

After it has completed you get a confirmation message or an error message if it was unable to carry out the task. *\[Figure-32c\]*

![Figure-33c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-optimize3.png "Figure-33c"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="help"></a>Inbuilt Help

In the control panel or the tool menu you have a help icon that when clicked will open a pop up wrapper of this specific guide. This gives you an easy way of checking the functionality of a particular item with out leaving the control panel. *\[Figure-2\]*

![Figure-2](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-help.png "Figure-2"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="options"></a>Extension Options

<div class="uk-alert">In the control panel or the tool menu you have an options icon that when clicked will open a new window containing the various extension options.</div>

### 1. <a name="options-general"></a>General Options

#### Facebook

The first option in this section allows you to load the Facebook JavaScript library through a specifically designed plugin that will ensure it's only loaded once and can be used by all the parts of the Social Links system. *\[Figure-26\]*

![Figure-26](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra5.png "Figure-26"){.coalaweb-docs}

The next option is the **Facebook Application ID** which will be used through out the Social Links system both by it's associated **Modules** and **Plugins**. This is a centralized location making it quick and easy to add the ID once and have the whole system use it. This can be overridden in some cases such as the Social Links module if needed.  *\[Figure-26a\]*

![Figure-26a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra6.png "Figure-26a"){.coalaweb-docs}

The next option allows you to choose which method you wish to use when sharing with Facebook. This option will affect the sharing of the Social Links and Tabs modules as well as the Share content plugin.  You can choose between the new Share Dialog (Official but requires an App ID ) or the old Sharer (Depreciated but more features). *\[Figure-26b\]*

<div class="uk-alert">I recommend at least setting up the new system by creating a Facebook App then if Facebook decides to completely remove the Sharer system you can easily switch over.</div>

![Figure-26b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra8.png "Figure-26b"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Twitter

If you want a Twitter username to be added to the end of Tweets generated by the Social Links system with the pre text **via** add it here in the following format @username otherwise leave this option blank. *\[Figure-26c\]*

![Figure-26c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra7.png "Figure-26c"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### URL Shortener

<div class="uk-alert">Note: cURL is necessary for the system to function correctly.</div>

To check if you have cURL installed open up your **PHP Information** page found under

    System → System Information → PHP Information

and scroll down or search the page looking for something similar to *\[Figure-24\]*

![Figure-24](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra1.png "Figure-24"){.coalaweb-docs}

Now that we have made sure cURL is installed lets move onto the configuration options. The first option 
is whether to turn on the shortening system and which service you wish to use (Currently only Google is available).

Next enter the **API Key** your received from your shortening service provider making sure to not leave any extra spaces.

<div class="uk-alert">For more info on how to get an API key scroll down to How do I get an API Key?</div>

Next you can choose which URL's you wish to have shortened keeping in mind that the system will alter URLs so in some cases the current votes will disappear. Don't worry they aren't lost you can turn off the system and they will return but it works both ways votes counted while using the shortening service in some cases will disappear when changing back. The decision to turn on URL shortening and where will ultimately depend on your circumstances. *\[Figure-24a\]*

<div class="uk-alert">I recommend at least turning it for the Social Links module as there aren't any visible counts.</div>

![Figure-24a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra2.png "Figure-24a"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### How do I get an API Key? (Google)

**Steps for creating API key for Google URL Shortening.**

-   Firstly log into your Google account and then go to the **Google Developers Console** using this [link](https://console.developers.google.com/)
-   Select a project, or create a new one.
-   Now from the left menu select **APIs and auth → APIs**
-   Scroll down until you find **URL Shortener API** and select it. 
-   In the next window click the **Enable API** button at the top.
-   Next select **Credentials** from the left menu.
-   Next select **Add credentials → API Key** from the top drop down menu. *\[Figure-24b\]*

![Figure-24b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra3.png "Figure-24b"){.coalaweb-docs}

-   Lastly select **Server Key** from the popup window. *\[Figure-24c\]*

![Figure-24c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra9.png "Figure-24c"){.coalaweb-docs}

-   When the window closes you should now have your new **API Key** displayed in the list of keys. *\[Figure-24d\]*

![Figure-24d](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-extra4.png "Figure-24d"){.coalaweb-docs}

### 2. <a name="options-content"></a>Like Plugin Options \[Pro Version\]

<div class="uk-alert">Some of the options selected here will affect the display of the buttons in Joomla, K2 and Zoo.</div>

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>Like Plugin Options</em> into three parts.</div>

#### Part 1 - Display Where

The first option is to turn on or off the display of the like social buttons. This option does in essence the same thing as unpublishing the associated plugin with out the hassle of searching through the plugins.

The next option allows you to choose if you want the social buttons to be displayed everywhere for example in each of the articles displayed in a blog layout or only when you have selected a particular article. This will affect the display of the buttons in both Joomla and K2. *\[Figure-3\]*

![Figure-3](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-like1.png "Figure-3"){.coalaweb-docs}

Next you have an opportunity to select which categories you wish the buttons to be displayed in. If you wish to select more than one just hold down **Shift** on your keyboard and select the categories with your mouse. If you want to exclude any articles use the last input field by entering their IDs one per line. *\[Figure-3a\]*

![Figure-3a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-like2.png "Figure-3a"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 2 - Layout

Next are the **Layout Options** here you can choose to display the buttons above the content, below the content or both. The buttons also have style options associated with them, you can display them in **Vertical** \[Bubble\], **Horizontal** or with **No Count**. The **Mail** and **Twitter** buttons are only avaliable in the **Horizontal** layout so they don't appear in the list. *\[Figure-3b\]*

![Figure-3b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-like3.png "Figure-3b"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 3 - Social

Next are the **Social Options** here you can chose which social networks you wish to display. These options will affect the display of the buttons in Joomla, K2 and Zoo. *\[Figure-3c\]*

![Figure-3c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-like4.png "Figure-3c"){.coalaweb-docs}

### 3. <a name="options-share"></a>Share Plugin Options \[Pro Version\]

<div class="uk-alert">Some of the options selected here will affect the display of the buttons in Joomla, K2 and Zoo.</div>

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>Share Plugin Options</em> into four parts.</div>

#### Part 1 - Display Where

The first option is to turn on or off the display of the share social buttons. This option does in essence the same thing as unpublishing the associated plugin with out the hassle of searching through the plugins.

The next option allows you to choose if you want the social buttons to be displayed everywhere for example in each of the articles displayed in a blog layout or only when you have selected a particular article. This will affect the display of the buttons in both Joomla and K2. *\[Figure-27\]*

![Figure-27](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-share1.png "Figure-27"){.coalaweb-docs}

Next you have an opportunity to select which categories you wish the buttons to be displayed in. If you wish to select more than one just hold down **Shift** on your keyboard and select the categories with your mouse. If you want to exclude any articles use the last input field by entering their IDs one per line. *\[Figure-27a\]*

![Figure-27a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-share2.png "Figure-27a"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 2 - General

Next are the **General Options** here you can choose to display the buttons above the content, below the content or both depending on the current layout. If you want the links to be set to No Follow select **Yes** for the next option. Lastly if you want them to be opened in a popup window select **Yes** for the **Use Popup** option. *\[Figure-27b\]*

![Figure-27b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-share3.png "Figure-27b"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 3 - Button Style

Next are the **Button Style Options** here you can choose to the icon/button style it's size and if it should have a count or not. Depending on which style you choose you have a few specific options such as **Labels** for the **UIkit** style.*\[Figure-27d\]*

![Figure-27d](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-share5.png "Figure-27d"){.coalaweb-docs}

<div class="uk-alert">The counts for the share buttons depend on your settings in the **Count** tab.</div>

#### Part 4 - Social

Next are the **Social Options** here you can chose which social networks you wish to display. These options will affect the display of both the
buttons in Joomla and K2. If you plan to display the Facebook button you will need to create a Facebook application **first** and then copy and paste the **ID** into the **Component** options under the **General** tab. *\[Figure-27c\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: The WhatsApp button will only display on mobile devices.</div>

![Figure-27c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-share4.png "Figure-27c"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Create Facebook Application

To get a **Facebook App ID** requires you to first create a Facebook Application but don’t worry it’s an easy process which we will walk your through in this [GUIDE](http://coalaweb.com/support/documentation/item/create-facebook-application "Facebook App Guide").

### 4. <a name="options-panel"></a>Panel Plugin Options \[Pro Version\]

![Figure-23](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-panel1.png "Figure-23"){.coalaweb-docs}

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>Social Panel Plugin Options</em> into five parts.</div>

#### Part 1 - Display Where

To make it easy to turn on or off the Social Panel plugin completely I have included a **Load Panel** option this will save you having to open up the plugin manager to disable it. Next you have an opportunity to select which categories you wish the buttons to be displayed in. If you wish to select more than one just hold down **Shift** on your keyboard and select the categories with your mouse. If you want to exclude any articles use the last input field by entering their IDs one per line. *\[Figure-23a\]*

![Figure-23a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-panel2.png "Figure-23a"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 2 - Layout & Style

Next are the **Layout & Style Options** these options will affect both the Fixed and Collapse style layouts. First you can choose if you want the panel to be visible all the time displayed to the side of the article content or Collapse which will hide the panel off the side of the page. The Collapse option becomes visible by clicking a tab that extends from the side of the page. 

The next option allows you to choose which side you want the panel displayed on.

The next option allows you to choose a **Theme** for the panel. I have included a few and will expand it over time but if you want to create your own have a look below.

The buttons also have style options associated with them, you can display them in **Vertical** \[Bubble\], or with **No Count**. The **Mail** and **Twitter** buttons are only avaliable in the **No Count** layout so they don't appear in the list.

#### Creating your own theme

Creating a theme is easy, just copy the default folder found in:

    media → coalawebsocial → plugins → content → socialpanel → themes

Give the theme a different name and edit the files as needed. All the
folders located in the themes directory will automatically be listed in
the **Form Theme** select list.

The last option listed under Layout and Style is Top Space this is theamount of space above the panel and will affect both panel styles. The top space is measure in % so just enter a number, 15 is the default and works well in most situations. *\[Figure-23b\]*

<div class="uk-alert">The Fixed Style will automatically convert to <em>Collapse</em> when the page reaches a certain size.</div>

![Figure-23b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-panel3.png "Figure-23b"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 3 - Fixed Style

The next couple of option only affect the Fixed panel style. First you can choose the Convert Width if the page is reduced smaller than the width entered here it will automatically convert to the Collapse style. The last option in this section is the side space this is the amount of space between the side of the page and the panel it is measured in % so just enter a number, 5 is the default and works well in most situations. *\[Figure-23c\]*

![Figure-23c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-panel4.png "Figure-23c"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 4 - Collapse Style

The next couple of option only affect the Collapse panel style. First
you can choose the type of button(tab) to want to use to trigger the
display of the panel. If you choose **Text** in the next option you can decide to have the text/button displayed vertically or horizontal. If you choose **Icon** you will have to fill in three
of the next four options. First choose the icon you wish to use it can
be stored locally or you can use an external URL for the image. Next set
the width and height of the icon in pixels. Note: Just enter a number
here with out the px. If you choose to use text which is a a great
option for multilingual sites you can change the displayed text here.
The default text is Share but if you do plan to use it on a multilingual
site it would be better to use the language files to manipulate this
text.

The next few options control the slide effect of the panel. The first
two options control the amount of time the panel takes to open and
close. Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate
slower animations, not faster ones. The default duration is 400
milliseconds. The last two options affect the animation style, you have
a lot to choose from so experiment until you find the ones you
like. *\[Figure-23d\]*

![Figure-23d](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-panel5.png "Figure-23d"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 5 - Social Options

Next are the **Social Options** here you can chose which social networks
you wish to display. These options will affect the display of both the
buttons in Joomla and K2. *\[Figure-23e\]*

![Figure-23e](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-panel6.png "Figure-23e"){.coalaweb-docs}

### 5. <a name="options-og"></a>Metadata Plugin Options \[Pro Version\]

The **CoalaWeb Metadata** system will help generate meta data in the **Open Graph**, **Twitter Card** and **Schema.org** formats and then place it in the head of your web pages. This information will then be used by elements such as the Facebook, Twitter and Google + vote and share buttons to get the best representation of the content being shared or voted on.

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>Metadata Options</em> into several parts.</div>

#### Part 1 - Display Where

The first option **Only Articles** allows you to choose if you want to add **Metadata** information to only the article views or to **Category Blog** and **Featured** views as well. *\[Figure-4\]*

![Figure-4](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-metadata1.png "Figure-4"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 2 - Meta Selection

<div class="uk-alert">The priority order in which each meta tag is selected is outlined below.</div>

##### Type

-   **1st attempt:** The first place the system will look is the CoalaWeb tab displayed in the both the Category and Article editors. This will always take priority over any other possible setting. If you set a type using the category editor tab this will be used in a category blog layout as there are multiple articles on the page. If you have set a type using the article editor tab then it will be used when viewing that specific article.
-   **2nd attempt:** If you haven’t used a CoalaWeb override tab the system will fall back to the  **Default Type** input field. *\[Figure 4a\]*

<div class="uk-alert">The best way to set up the type is to use Article for the default type and for category blog layouts assign a type of blog to the category using the CoalaWeb override tab in the category editor.</div> 

##### Title

-   **1st attempt:** The first place the system will look is the CoalaWeb tab displayed in the both the Category and Article editors. This will always take priority over any other possible setting. If you set a title using the category editor tab this will be used in a category blog layout as there are multiple articles on the page. If you have set a title using the article editor tab then it will be used when viewing that specific article.
-   **2nd attempt:** If you have set a **Default Title** this will be next in line to be used for the title. *\[Figure 4a\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: It's recommended to leave this parameter blank</div> 

-   **3rd attempt:** If you haven’t used either a CoalaWeb override tab or the default title field then the title will be populated in the following way:
    -   **Category View** = The category title.
    -   **Featured View** = The title of the first article.
    -   **Article View** = The title of the article being viewed.
-   **4th attempt:** If a title still hasn't been found and you have added a **Fallback** title it will be used as the last resort.

##### Site Name

-   **1st attempt:** If you have set a **Default Site Name** this will be used for the site name tag. *\[Figure 4a\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: It's recommended to leave this parameter blank</div>

-   **2nd attempt:** If you haven’t chosen a **Default Site Name** the system will use the **Site Name** set in your website's **Global Configuration**. *\[Figure-4a\]*

##### Description

A page description expands on the page title by including additional details typically used as a document preview. The description should provide a concise summary of the page in approximately 200 characters or fewer.

-   **1st attempt:** The first place the system will look is the CoalaWeb tab displayed in the both the Category and Article editors. This will always take priority over any other possible setting. If you set a description using the category editor tab this will be used in a category blog layout as there are multiple articles on the page. If you have set a description using the article editor tab then it will be used when viewing that specific article.
-   **2nd attempt:** If you have set a **Default Description** this will be next in line to be used for the description. *\[Figure 4a\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: It's recommended to leave this parameter blank</div>

-   **3rd Attempt:** If you haven’t chosen a default description the system will move onto the meta description of the article being viewed or of the first one displayed in Blog or Featured view.
-   **4th attempt:** If the first three options return no description its on to the intro text of the article being viewed or of the first one displayed in Blog or Featured view. The plugin will attempt to extract the first 300 words of the intro text and use those as your description.
-   **5th attempt:** If a description still hasn't been found and you have added a **Fallback** description it will be used as the last resort.

##### Image

Let's face it the image is very important and I'm confident using the options below you can get the image you prefer to be used. *\[Figure-4a\]*

-   **1st attempt:** The first place the system will look to is the CoalaWeb tab displayed in the both the Category and Article editors. This will always take priority over any other possible setting. If you set an image using the category editor tab this will be used in a category blog layout as there are multiple articles on the page. If you have set an image using the article editor tab then it will be used when viewing that specific article.
-   **2nd attempt:** If you have set a **Default Image** this will be next in line to be used for the image. *\[Figure 4a\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: It's recommended to leave this parameter blank</div>

<div class="uk-alert">The next option has been superceded by the <em>Meta Fields</em> system that adds a CoalaWeb tab to both the category and article editors. I have left it in to stop issues with users that have already set it up.</div>

-   **3rd attempt:** If you haven’t used either a CoalaWeb override tab or the default image field then the system move on to searching the cwopengraph folder **\[images/cwopengraph\]** for an image that matches the id of the current article. For example you want a specific image for your latest article which has an ID of 1 then rename the image you want to use to 1.jpg and upload it to the image/cwopengraph folder. The plugin will search in this folder for matching images and if it finds one it will be add to the **og:image** and **twitter:image** meta tags. Supported image types are jpg, png and gif.
-   **4th attempt:** If the previous options have failed to return an image the system will next look to the articles **Intro Image** and if it finds one it will be used.
-   **5th attempt:** The next thing the system will do is search through the article content to find an image and if it does that image will be used.
-   **6th attempt:** If an image still hasn't been found and you have added a **Fallback** image it will be used as the last resort.

<div class="uk-alert">Note: FB will only use images that are at least 200x200 px. FB prefers images that are measured in multiples of 100 and square format.</div>

<div class="uk-alert">Note: Twitter will only use images that are at least 280x150 px.</div>

<div class="uk-alert">Note: Google will display the image in a large format (full-bleed) if it is at lease 400px wide with an aspect ratio no wider that 5:2(width:height) other wise it will be scaled and cropped.</div>

#### Part 3 - Facebook \[Open Graph\]

##### Add Open Graph

Turn on or off the inclusion of **Open Graph** meta tags. *\[Figure-4b\]*

##### Application ID and Administrators

Here you can enter your Facebook Application ID (optional) and or Administrators (optional). *\[Figure-4b\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: The App ID and Admins options will also be used by the Meta Menu plugin and Zoo. The App ID in this section will override the one set under the General options tab.</div>

##### Add Namespace

This option allows you to add the Open Graph protocol **namespaces** to our **<head>** tag.  *\[Figure-4b\]*

    xmlns:og="http://ogp.me/ns#"
    xmlns:fb="http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"

![Figure-4b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-metadata3.png "Figure-4b"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 4 - Twitter \[Twitter Card\]

##### Add Twitter Card

Turn on or off the inclusion of **Twitter Card** meta tags. *\[Figure-4c\]*

##### Website @username

Here you can enter the Twitter **@username** for the website used in the card footer.*\[Figure-4c\]*

##### Content @username

Here you can enter the Twitter **@username** for the content author. *\[Figure-4c\]*

![Figure-4c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-metadata4.png "Figure-4c"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 5 Google \[Schema.org\]

<div class="uk-alert">Note: Google has certain requirements to pass it's **Structured Data Test** so please fill in all the fields below to make sure your pages comply.</div>

<div class="uk-alert">Note: For Zoo content please be sure to assign elements to all the available positions in the **CW Open Graph** layout. Click [Here](#plg-og) for more info.</div>

The first option is to turn on or off the inclusion of **Schema (microdata)** meta tags. The next option is a **fallback** image for when no other image is avaliable due to Google expecting one. Two more options that Google expects are a **Publisher** and **Publisher Logo**. If these options are left blank the system will resort to using a generic image and the site name as the publisher. *\[Figure-4d\]*

![Figure-4d](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-metadata5.png "Figure-4d"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 6 Fallback Options

The options in this section will be used when no other data is available so consider them <em>Fallback</em> options. This is very handy for example to assign a logo image that can be used when an article doesn't have one. They will automatically be used for Native Joomla and Zoo content

The **Fallback (Everywhere)** option gives you the ability to use the fallback system everywhere that isn't Native Joomla and Zoo content. Note: For menu items this can still be overridden on a per menu bases using the CoalaWeb tab in the menu editor.  

If you have choose yes to fallback everywhere and you want to exclude certain extensions from using the fallback settings you can add them into the **Fallback Exclude** field separated by a comma. For example: com_k2,com_contact *\[Figure-4e\]*

![Figure-4e](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-metadata6.png "Figure-4e"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 7 Default Options

If you want certain information to always be used within the meta tags set it below. This can still be overridden by the settings in the CoalaWeb editor tabs.  *\[Figure-4a\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: It's recommend to leave these options blank.</div>

![Figure-4a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-metadata2.png "Figure-4a"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="options-count"></a>6. Count Options

CoalaWeb Social links has a count system builtin that can check a page's social counts based on it's URL and then store the information in the database. This allows the counts to be retrieved from the database when displaying the buttons removing the need to check each social network on every page load. *\[Figure-30\]*

![Figure-30](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-count1.png "Figure-30"){.coalaweb-docs}

The count system currently supports **Joomla**, **K2** and **Zoo** content to varying degrees. You can choose to check an individual page's count with the **Check Count(Article)** option for all three while **Joomla** and **K2** give you the option to **Check Count (Category/Featured/List)** which will check all the articles on the page at once. **Joomla** and **K2** also have a few more options to exclude individual articles/items or categories from being counted.  *\[Figure-30a\]*

![Figure-30a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-count2.png "Figure-30a"){.coalaweb-docs}

The next group of options are **what to check** which give you option to choose which social networks to check so if you only plan to display a **Facebook** and **Google** button you could just turn those two on. Keep in mind the counts are independent of the displayed buttons in the front end so you could display no buttons and turn on the counts here to monitor from the Social Links control panel what your page counts are. *\[Figure-30b\]*

![Figure-30b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-count3.png "Figure-30b"){.coalaweb-docs}

 The last option in this section is **when to check** which controls how long a page's information is stored before it is checked again. The **locktime** is set in minutes and the default is **1440** which is one day. *\[Figure-30c\]*

![Figure-30c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-config-count4.png "Figure-30c"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="options-updates"></a>7. Update Options

The CoalaWeb Social Links extension integrates with the inbuilt **Joomla Update** system so both **Core** and **Pro** users can keep their extension up to date. For **Core** users when you see updates listed in the Joomla update manager feel free to select it and update. 

For **Pro** subscribers you will need to make sure you still have a valid subscription and that you have entered your **Download ID** in either the **Control Panel** input field. *\[Figure-28\]*

![Figure-28](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/general/updates/cw-updates-cpanel.png "Figure-28"){.coalaweb-docs}

 Or through the component configuration options under **Updates**. *\[Figure-28a\]*

<div class="uk-alert">TIP: To stop any typos I recommend copying and pasting the Download ID and also to check for no spaces at the end.</div>

#### <a name="options-downloadid"></a> Where can I find my Download ID?

To see your **Download ID** you will need to log into [coalaweb.com](http://coalaweb.com) and then go to:

    Members -> My Subscriptions

You will then see the ID displayed in the module titled **Download ID**. *\[Figure-28b\]*

### <a name="mod-general"></a>General Display Options

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>General Display Options</em> into three parts.</div>

#### Part 1

In this section you can choose the icon style, size and alignment, title alignment as well as the title format. *\[Figure-9\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Want to create a custom theme? Have a look at <a href="/support/documentation/item/coalaweb-social-links-guide#mod-custom-theme">Creating a Custom Theme</a></div>

### <a name="mod-custom-theme"></a>Creating a Custom Theme

Creating a theme is easy, just copy the custom-example folder found in:

    media → coalawebsocial → components → sociallinks → themes-icon

Give the theme a different name, edit the files as needed and of course add your custom icons. 
All the folders located in the themes-icon directory will automatically be listed in the **Icon Styles** select list.

#### Part 3

The last General Display options control if the buttons should be opened in a **Popup Window**. I recommend having it on for the Share buttons and off for the Follow Us buttons. *\[Figure-9b\]*

![Figure-9b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-mod-config-general3.png "Figure-9b"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="mod-bookmark-gen"></a>Share This General

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>Share This General</em> into two parts.</div>

#### Part 1 - Default

If you want the same title to be used for all of the **Share This** icons all of the time add it here. If have chosen a default link I recommend you add a default title as well. If left blank the current title will be used. 

If you want the same link to be used for all of the **Share This** icons all of the time add it here. If left blank the current URL will be used. - Note: When adding your link use the domain minus the http:// only add the link in the following format www.socialmedia.com. You can also add a default description that will be used in the email produced by the **Share This** email button. *\[Figure-10\]*

![Figure-10](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-mod-config-bookmark1.png "Figure-10"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 2 - Display

This section controls what is displayed in the **Share This** part of the module. You can choose to display a title including what text will be displayed. 

<div class="uk-alert">Note: If your site is multilingual leave blank and use the language files or a language override.</div>

You can also choose the color of the title and the border color but only if you selected yes to **Display Borders** in the
**General Display Options** section. This border will surround the **Share This** part of the module. You can enter a \# followed by a
color reference code such as \#000000 for black or you can use the color chooser box to the right of the input field. The last option is used to display some text above the **Share This** section of the module. *\[Figure-10a\]*

### <a name="mod-bookmark-soc"></a>Share This Social

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>Share This Social Options</em> into two parts.</div>

#### Part 1 - Facebook

Facebook has announced that they have deprecated the **Sharer** code in preference of their new **Share Dialog** system, which requires a Facebook App ID. If you plan to display the Facebook button you will need to create a Facebook application **first** and then copy and paste the **ID** into the **Component** options under the **General** tab. The option below will override the component if needed. For more info on how this is done read below.*\[Figure-10b\]*

![Figure-10b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-mod-config-bookmark3.png "Figure-10b"){.coalaweb-docs}

To get a **Facebook App ID** requires you to first create a Facebook Application but don’t worry it’s an easy process which we will walk your through in this [GUIDE](http://coalaweb.com/support/documentation/item/create-facebook-application "Facebook App Guide").

#### Part 2 - Social A - Z

For the social bookmark options themselves, scroll down the list ticking the ones you want to display and that's it for the **Share This** section.*\[Figure-10c\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: The WhatsApp button will only display on mobile devices.</div>

### <a name="mod-follow-gen"></a>Follow Us General

This section controls what is displayed in the **Follow Us** part of the
module. You can choose to display a title including what text will be
displayed.

<div class="uk-alert">Note: If your site is multilingual leave blank and use the language files or a language override.</div>

You can also choose the color of the title and the
border color but only if you selected yes to **Display Borders** in the
**General Display Options** section. This border will surround the
**Follow Us** part of the module. You can enter a \# followed by a color

### <a name="mod-follow-az"></a>Follow Us A-Z

To make finding the social media icons easier I have broken them up into groups of 5 letters organized alphabetically. For example if you are look for Facebook just select the F -J group. Just work your way through the groups ticking the ones you want to display and adding their corresponding links. *\[Figure-11a\]*

![Figure-11a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-mod-config-follow2.png "Figure-11a"){.coalaweb-docs}

<div class="uk-alert">When adding links use the domain without the http:// for example <em>www.facebook.com</em> or for <em>Mail Us</em> email@social.com </div>

### <a name="mod-follow-cus"></a>Follow Us Custom

Due to popular demand there is now a **Custom Option** and for *PRO* users **Three Custom Options** to help with those situation where only a custom icon will do. To add a custom icon is very similar to a standard **Follow Us** option you have to chose to display it, add a link and a few more options. 

First lets decided if we want a custom button to display at all. Next is the **Hover Text** this displays when the icon is hovered over by a mouse. Now we have an important one the link to the place you want the user to visit if they click the button. The next options allows you to choose it you want the link to open in the same window maybe for a contact form on your site or in a new window if they are leaving your site. 

The next couple of options help you get the all important icon displaying, you can select the **Custom Icon** that you want to display from your local images directory or use an external one by entering in the complete URL for example http://coalaweb.com/images/example.png. *\[Figure-11b\]*

#### Tips
-   When adding your link use the domain without the http:// for example **www.facebook.com**
-   When using an external icon use the complete URL for example http://coalaweb.com/images/example.png
-   When choosing a icon keep in mind what size you selected in the **General Options** section.

### <a name="mod-advanced"></a>Advanced Options

The CoalaWeb Social Links module also has a few of what I consider **Advanced Options** such as the option to assign a **Module Class Suffix** or choose whether to use **Cache** including the **Cache Time**. 

There is also an option to turn off the **Module CSS** if you want to add your own styling. Turn on **Link Text** if you want to have text appear where buttons normally would on screen readers and or systems that don't load CSS. Lastly is the **NoFollow** option that provides a way to tell
search engines not to follow a particular link. *\[Figure-12\]*

## <a name="module-tabs"></a>Social Tabs \[M\] \[Pro\]

### <a name="mod-tabs-first"></a>First Thing

The first thing you will need to do to ensure that the Social Tabs module functions correctly is to publish it to the correct **Position**. I recommend using **debug** as it won't affect the display of your other content and it's an available in the majority of templates. If you are using a **RocketTheme** template I have had success using the **utility-a** position. *\[Figure-25\]*

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up the <em>General Display Options</em> into four parts.</div>

#### Part 1

In this section you can choose which **Side** you want the module to display on, the **Offset** (the amount of space from the top or bottom of the page) and either **Top** or **Bottom**. *\[Figure-25a\]*

![Figure-25a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-tabs-mod-config-general1.png "Figure-25a"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 2

This section covers **Waypoints** which allow you to use HTML elements on the page to trigger the appearance and disappearance of the tabs. With the first option you can turn this feature on or off. For the next two options you have to enter the waypoints that you want to use to trigger Tabs.  can be any HTML element's an ID **\#example** or a Class **\.example** I recommend using an **ID** as it's unique. *\[Figure-25j\]*

The next couple of options help you get the all important icon displaying, you can select the **Custom Icon** that you want to display from your local images directory or use an external one by entering in the complete URL for example http://coalaweb.com/images/example.png. *\[Figure-25g\]*

#### Tips
-   When adding your link use the domain without the http:// for example **www.facebook.com**
-   When using an external icon use the complete URL for example http://coalaweb.com/images/example.png
-   When choosing a icon keep in mind the standard icons are 48px png images with a clear background.

### <a name="mod-tabs-colors"></a>Tab Colors

In this section you have two option to choose for each of the tabs including the custom ones. The first one is the default background color of a particular tab and the second one is the hover color that the tab will change to when hovered over. You can click the input to use a popup color selector or enter the colors **Hex** code minus the **#**. *\[Figure-25h\]*

### <a name="mod-tabs-order"></a>Tab Order

In this section you can choose the order you want the tabs to be displayed in. To reorder the tabs just drag and drop them to the location you want them displayed its that simple. *\[Figure-25i\]*

To make it easy to identify which tab is which I have added a key letter to the end of each of their names for more details see below.

#### Tab Key:

* [S]=Share
* [F]=Follow
* [C]=Custom

### <a name="mod-tabs-advanced"></a>Advanced Options

First you get the choice to use **CSS** for the rendering of the module or **jQuery**. *\[Figure-25d\]*

Next you have the option to assign a **Unique Module ID** to stop conflicts. You can also give the it a **Module Class Suffix** or choose whether to use **Cache** including the **Cache Time**. The last option is **NoFollow** that provides a way to tell search engines not to follow a particular link. *\[Figure-25d\]*

## <a name="module-page"></a>Page \[M\]

<div class="uk-alert">Note: This module supersedes the depreciated CoalaWeb Likebox module.</div>

Page is a social module that enables Facebook Page owners to attract and gain likes from their own website. It enables people using your website to do the following:

-   See how many people like the Page, and which of their friends like
    it, too.
-   Read recent posts from the Page.
-   Share the Page with one click.
-   Like the Page with one click.

<div class="uk-alert">Quote: The minimum supported widget width is 280 pixels.</div>

### <a name="mod-page-general"></a>General Options

The first option in this section allows you to add your Facebook page. The easiest way to do that is open up your page and copy and paste the link in the box. *\[Figure-29\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: The URL should be in the following format https://www.facebook.com/CoalaWeb.</div>

![Figure-29](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-page-mod-config-general.png "Figure-29"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="mod-page-layout"></a>Layout Options

The first option in this section is what default width you want to set for the widget. The Page Widget will automatically adapt to the width of its parent element on page load (min. 280px / max. 500px). If the width of the parent element is bigger than the Page Widget width it will maintain the value defined in Widget Width.

The next option allows you to set the default height for the widget. The minimum pixel height of the Page Widget is 280 and the maximum is 500.

The next option is the **Module Width** not to be confused with the **Widget Width** this is the surrounding Joomla module. You might want to reduce this width if for example you only have two modules displayed at the bottom of your page and you want the Page to be a bit more compact. Don't forget the Page Widget will automatically adapt to the width of its parent element on page load as I mentioned at the start of this section. 

Set the last option to Yes if your template is having trouble configuring the right height for the content. *\[Figure 29a\]*

### <a name="plg-og"></a>Open Graph \[Pc\]\[Pro\]

The **CoalaWeb Metadata** system will help generate meta data in the **Open Graph**, **Twitter Card** and **Schema.org** formats and then place it in the head of your web pages. This information will then be used by elements such as the Facebook, Twitter and Google + vote and share buttons to get the best representation of the content being shared or voted on.

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up this section into three parts.</div>

#### Part 1 - Open Graph

**What is Open Graph?**

> An Open Graph object is a regular web page with additional structured
> data marked up using RDFa Core 1.1 syntax placed in your HTML
> document's element. A Facebook server downloads a copy of your web
> page, extracts relevant data, and stores an object representation for
> future use. Facebook attempts to extract relevant data from links
> shared on Facebook as well as URL properties passed as part of an Open
> Graph action.

Facebook Open Graph objects are marked up using Open Graph protocol,properties specific to Facebook, and properties specific to your Facebook application.

The CoalaWeb Metadata plugin allows you to add default values for the parameters outlined below or dynamically populates them in a variety of different ways see [Social Metadata Options](#options-og) for more details. *\[Figure-21\]*

##### Open Graph Parameters

-   og:url
-   og:type
-   og:title
-   og:image
-   og:description
-   og:site\_name
-   fb:app\_id (Optional)
-   fb:admins (Optional)

![Figure-21](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-plg-opengraph.png "Figure-21"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 2 - Twitter Card

**What is a Twitter Card?**

> With Twitter Cards, you can attach rich photos, videos and media experience to Tweets that drive traffic to your website. Simply add a >few lines of HTML to your webpage, and users who Tweet links to your content will have a “Card” added to the Tweet that's visible to >all of their followers.

The CoalaWeb Metadata system allows you to add default values for the parameters outlined below or dynamically populates them in a variety of different ways see [Social Metadata Options](#options-og) for more details. *\[Figure-21a\]*

##### Twitter Card Parameters

-   twitter:url
-   twitter:title
-   twitter:image
-   twitter:description
-   twitter:creator
-   twitter:site
-   twitter:card


![Figure-21a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-plg-twittercard.png "Figure-21a"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Part 3 - Schema.org

**What is Schema.org?**

> Schema.org provides a collection of shared vocabularies webmasters can use to mark up their pages in ways that can be understood by the major search engines: Google, Microsoft, Yandex and Yahoo!

When you share something through Google the information that is included in the accompanying window (rich snippet) can be more accurately chosen using schema.org tags.
 
The CoalaWeb Metadata system dynamically populates a series of JSON-LD \[JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data\] encoded elements to meet Google's **Structured Data Test** criteria. *\[Figure-21c\]*

##### Schema.org Parameters

     "@context": "http://schema.org",
             "@type": "Article",
             "inLanguage" : "",
             "headline" : "",

### <a name="plg-mf"></a>Meta Fields \[Pc\]\[Pro & J3.+\]

The **CoalaWeb Meta Fields** content plugin helps add **Open Graph** and **Twitter** meta information to your Joomla content while using the **Article** and or **Category** editors.

<div class="uk-alert">To make it easier to follow I have broken up <em>Meta Fields</em> into two parts.</div>

#### Part 1 - Article Editor

When using your article editor you will now have a new tab available called **CoalaWeb**. This new tab contains **Metadata** input fields that will override all other settings you have chosen and are specific to the article currently being edited.

The first section gives you the opportunity to add a specific **Type**, **Title**, **Description** and or **Image** for the article being edited. Depending on what you have chosen in the **Component** options these setting will potential affect the display of both **Open Graph** and **Twitter** meta tags.

Keep in mind that all these settings are optional and you can feel free to leave one or all of them blank to let the system decide for you. Example use would be setting the **Type** in the component or your categories options to **Blog** and for your articles to **Article**. *\[Figure-28\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Note: This is really handy for articles that don't have any images but you still want one in your OG tags.</div>

![Figure-28](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-mf-plg-article.png "Figure-28"){.coalaweb-docs}

The second section gives you the opportunity to add Open Graph **Video** tags to your articles. If you want to add video tags please fill in all the options which included **Type**, **URL**, **Secure URL**, **Width** and **Height**. *\[Figure-28a\]*

![Figure-28a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-mf-plg-article2.png "Figure-28a"){.coalaweb-docs}

Typical video settings would look something like this:

-   Type: Flash
-   URL: http://www.youtube.com/example
-   Secure URL: https://www.youtube.com/example
-   Width: 1280
-   Height: 720

#### Part 2 - Category Editor

When using your category editor you will now have a new tab available called **CoalaWeb**. This new tab contains **Metadata** input fields that will override all other settings you have chosen and are specific to the category currently being edited.

You will have the opportunity to add a specific **Type**, **Title**, **Description** and or **Image** for the category being edited. Depending on what you have chosen in the **Component** options these setting will potential affect the display of both **Open Graph** and **Twitter** meta tags.

Keep in mind that all these settings are optional and you can feel free to leave one or all of them blank to let the system decide for you. Example use would be setting the **Type** in the component or your categories options to **Blog** and for your articles to **Article**. *\[Figure-28b\]*

![Figure-28b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-mf-plg-article.png "Figure-28b"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="plg-mm"></a>Menu Meta \[Ps\]\[Pro & J3.+]

The **CoalaWeb Menu Meta** system plugin allows you to add **Open Graph** and **Twitter Card** tags to basically any menu item. To stop conflicts with the other CoalaWeb content meta data plugins these tags will not be displayed for regular Joomla content items such as Categories and or Articles. If you want to override the automatic creation of meta tags for a Joomla Article or Category please use the CoalaWeb tab displayed in their respective editors. *\[Figure-29\]*

![Figure-29](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-mm-plg.png "Figure-29"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="plg-fbjs"></a>Facebook JS \[Ps\]

This plugin has been specifically designed to load the Facebook JavaScript library making it available to all the parts of the **Social Links** system while ensuring it is only loaded once. It also incorporates the Facebook **Application ID** entered in the component configuration options. *\[Figure-21b\]*

![Figure-21b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-slinks-plg-fbjs.png "Figure-21b"){.coalaweb-docs}

### <a name="plg-zoo"></a>Zoo Elements \[Ps\]\[Pro\]

The **CoalaWeb Zoo** plugin is a system plugin designed to integrate **custom elements & layouts** into your Zoo applications. Currently there are two custom elements created by this plugin and they are explained in detail below.

#### <a name="plg-zoo-social"></a>Custom Element - Social Likes

This custom element integrates a variety of popular social vote and or share buttons into your zoo applications. Once the plugin is installed and publish you will be able to carry out the following steps to get them displaying through out your Zoo content.

#### Step 1

Open up **Zoo** and click the small **Gear Icon**. *\[Figure-22\]*

![Figure-22](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config1.png "Figure-22"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Step 2

Now select the **App** you want to add the CoalaWeb Social Likes button
too for this example we will choose Blog so click **Blog** and then
select **Article \> Edit Elements**. *\[Figure-22a\]*

![Figure-22a](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config2.png "Figure-22a"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Step 3

If the plugin was installed and published properly you should now have a
new element available under **Social** called **CoalaWeb Social Likes**
click it once to add it to your **Article** layout. *\[Figure-22b\]*

![Figure-22b](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config3.png "Figure-22b"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Step 4

Now give your new element a **Name**, **Description** and choose the
appropriate settings for the other options, when you are ready click
**Save & Close**. *\[Figure-22c\]*

![Figure-22c](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config4.png "Figure-22c"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Step 5

Now we need to add the newly available element to our **Template** for
this example we are using the **Default template** and the **Full
Layout**. *\[Figure-22d\]*

![Figure-22d](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config5.png "Figure-22d"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Step 6

Once the new window has opened you can drag and drop the **CoalaWeb
Social** Custom element over to your desired location in this example I have chosen
**Bottom**. Feel free to turn on or off the **Label** or even give it an
**Alternative Label**. When you are happy click **Save & Close**. *\[Figure-22e\]*

![Figure-22e](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config6.png "Figure-22e"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Step 7

Now in each of your **Articles** you will have a new option named what you
chose back at the start in our case **CoalaWeb Social**. Just set it to **Yes**
and the buttons will magically appear. *\[Figure-22f\]*

![Figure-22f](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config7.png "Figure-22f"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### <a name="plg-zoo-og"></a>Custom Layout - Open Graph

This custom layout integrates **Open Graph** metadata into your Zoo content which makes sharing and voting much more accurate and professional.

The **Open Graph** tags added to your **Zoo** content will come from two sources which are explained in detail below.

#### Source 1

The first source is the **Component Configuration Options** and they cover the follow **Open Graph** tags.
-   og:type
-   fb:app\_id (Optional)
-   fb:admins (Optional)

#### Source 2 

The second source is the **CW Open Graph Extension Layout** which covers the following **Open Graph** tags.

-   og:url
-   og:title
-   og:image
-   og:image:width
-   og:image:height
-   og:description

The next three positions are specifically used for **Schema (microdata)** so if you have turn this option on make sure to assign items to all of the avaliable positions. This will ensure that you pages pass Google's **Structured Data Test**.

-   og:author
-   og:creation:date
-   og:modification:date

Setting up the **CW Open Graph Extension Layout** is easy just follow the steps outlined below.

#### Step 1

Open up **Zoo** and click the small **Gear Icon**. *\[Figure-22g\]*

![Figure-22g](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config1.png "Figure-22g"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Step 2

Now select the **App** you want to add the **Open Graph** tags too for this example we will be using **Blog**. In the next screen you should now see a new **Article Extension Layout** called **CW Open Graph** select it to move onto the next step. *\[Figure-22h\]*

![Figure-22h](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config8.png "Figure-22h"){.coalaweb-docs}

#### Step 3

In this step you will need to **Drag and Drop** the relevant **Core** and **Custom** items over to their **Open Graph Positions**. If you are not sure what to place where use the image below as a guide. *\[Figure-22i\]*

![Figure-22i](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config9.png "Figure-22i"){.coalaweb-docs}

Now if you check the source code of one of your **Zoo Content Items** you should now see **Open Graph** tags and depending on your other setting **Twitter Card** tags as well. *\[Figure-22j\]*

![Figure-22j](http://cdn.coalaweb.com/images/docs/joomla-extensions/social-links/cw-zoo-plg-config10.png "Figure-22j"){.coalaweb-docs}

If you have chosen to display **Schema (microdata)** you will also be able to see it displayed in your page's source code.   *\[Figure-22k\]*
