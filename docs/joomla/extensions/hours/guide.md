## <a name="updates"></a>Updates

The **CoalaWeb Hours** extension integrates with the inbuilt **Joomla Update** system so both **Core** and **Pro** users can keep their extension up to date. For **Core** users when you see updates listed in the Joomla update manager feel free to select it and update. 

For **Pro** subscribers you will need to make sure you still have a valid subscription and that you have entered your **Download ID** into the **System - CW Gears** plugin. *\[Figure-11\]*

<div class="uk-alert">Not sure where to find your Download ID? Click <a href="#options-downloadid">HERE</a> for more info.</div>

Inside the **CW Gears** plugin options your will find a tab titled **Updates** and under it a **Download ID** input field. I recommend you copy and paste your **Download ID** into this field to reduce the risk of a typo and also to check for no spaces at the end.  *\[Figure-11a\]*

To see your **Download ID** you will need to log into [coalaweb.com](https://coalaweb.com) and then go to:

## <a name="mod-hours"></a>Hours Module

The **CoalaWeb Hours** module has a huge list of options so we have broken them up into several sections which are explained in detail below.

### <a name="mod-general"></a>General Options

To make it easy to explain I have broken this section up into 3 parts.

**Part 1 General**

The first few option in this section control how and if a title will be displayed such as it's text, format and for **Pro** users the option of an icon. If you are a **Pro** subscriber you will also have the option to display some **Pre** text after the title. If you do want to have some **Pre** text displayed just enter the text with out any HTML formating the module will take care of that for you. *\[Figure-1a\]*

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-1a.png">![Figure-1a](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-1a.png "Figure-1a"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

**Part 2 Date & Time**

If you are a **Pro** subscriber you get 5 date format options to choose from while **Core** user just get the default. For both **Core** and **Pro** users you get the choice of displaying the **Time** in either **12** hour time with **am** or **pm** displayed after it or **24** hour time the choice is yours. *\[Figure-1b\]*

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-1b.png">![Figure-1b](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-1b.png "Figure-1b"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

**Part 3 Layout & Style**

The first option is for **Pro** subscriber giving the option to choose 1 of 4 **Panel** styles. 

<div class="uk-alert">Width Guide: Desktop = 960px, Tablet = 768px and Mobile = 480px</div>

The next three options are avaliable for both **Core** and **Pro** users and will affect the overall width of the module while viewing it on a **Desktop**, **Tablet** and **Mobile**. What you choose here will depend on a few things such as the module position and avaliable space. *\[Figure-1b\]*

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-1c.png">![Figure-1c](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-1c.png "Figure-1c"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

### <a name="mod-hours-opt"></a>Hours Options

To make it easy to explain I have broken this section up into 4 parts.

<div class="uk-alert">Width Guide: Desktop = 960px, Tablet = 768px and Mobile = 480px</div>

In this section you can choose the **Title** and **Hours** formats plus how many columns you want to use with the added power to choose based on the size of the screen being used. You can for example have three columns on a nice big desktop screen and then one column on a small mobile device. *\[Figure-2b\]*

These settings are fully responsive which you can test by minimizing your browser screen on your desktop to simulate different screen sizes and see the changes live. 

<div class="uk-alert">If there are less items than columns the system will automatically adjust.</div>

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-2b.png">![Figure-2b](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-2b.png "Figure-2b"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

In this section you have two closing and opening times per day which will control whether the sign will display open/break/closed. The time between the ending of the **First Schedule** and the starting of the **Second Schedule** will display as a **Break**. To not use the **Second Schedule** leave them blank. *\[Figure-5b\]*

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-5b.png">![Figure-5b](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-5b.png "Figure-5b"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

### <a name="mod-zones"></a>Zones Options

To make it easy to explain I have broken this section up into 3 parts.

**Part 1 General**

The first few option in this section control how the **Title**, **Date**, **Time** and **Zone** text will be displayed such as their format and for **Pro** users the option of an icon can also be displayed for each of them. *\[Figure-3a\]*

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-3a.png">![Figure-3a](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-3a.png "Figure-3a"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

**Part 2 Columns**

<div class="uk-alert">Width Guide: Desktop = 960px, Tablet = 768px and Mobile = 480px</div>

In this section you can choose how many columns you want to use with the added power to choose based on the size of the screen being used. You can for example have three columns on a nice big desktop screen and then one column on a small mobile device. *\[Figure-3b\]*

These settings are fully responsive which you can test by minimizing your browser screen on your desktop to simulate different screen sizes and see the changes live. 

<div class="uk-alert">If there are less items than columns the system will automatically adjust.</div>

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-3b.png">![Figure-3b](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-3b.png "Figure-3b"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

**Part 3 Zones**

<div class="uk-alert">Note: If your site is multilingual leave text fields blank and use the language files or a language override.</div>

In this section you set the specific information you want to be displayed for each of your avaliable **Zones**. **Pro** users get three options while **Core** get two. You can choose to turn a zone on or off as well as choose the **Title** text and turn on or off the individual parts **Date**, **Time** and **Zone**. *\[Figure-3c\]*

<div class="uk-alert">The visitors time zone is determined by jsTimezoneDetect which does not do geo-location nor does it take into consideration historical time zones. If you think your visitors will be unhappy with their time zone being displayed for example as Europe/Berlin when the visitor is in fact in Europe/Stockholm you may want to set the visitor's zone to not display. Keep in mind from a modern time perspective they are identical.</div>

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-3c.png">![Figure-3c](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-3c.png "Figure-3c"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>

For **Pro** subscribers you get an additional **Custom 1** zone where you can specify a time zone from the drop down list and then set up the other options as previously discussed. *\[Figure-3d\]*

### <a name="mod-advanced"></a>Advanced Options

The CoalaWeb Hours module also has a few of what I consider **Advanced Options** such as choosing which **Uikit Prefix** to use, the option to assign a **Module Class Suffix** or to choose whether to use **Cache** including the **Cache Time**.  *\[Figure-4a\]*

<a data-lightbox="on" href="https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-4a.png">![Figure-4a](https://d1tgoab1lhw0tx.cloudfront.net/images/docs/joomla-extensions/hours/cw-hours-mod-hours-4a.png "Figure-4a"){.uk-thumbnail .uk-thumbnail-mini}</a>
