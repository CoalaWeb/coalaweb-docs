## <a class="doc-top" name="overview"></a>Overview

**CoalaWeb Users** allows users to select a user group while registering and redirect them after successful login based on their assigned group.

## <a name="options"></a>Options

The CoalaWeb Users plugin has quite a few options so we have broken them up into 2 main sections which are explained in detail below.

### <a name="opt-users"></a>Users

The first option in this section allows you to turn on or off the user group form field in the registration form. You can then set if you want to be a required field and which group should be set as the default option. *\[Figure 1\]*

 Next is the **Allowed Groups** option where you can defined the groups you want offered in the form field. The last two options in this section allow you to quickly and easily add a custom label and description to the form field. Note: If your site is multilingual leave the last two options blank and use the language files. *\[Figure 2\]*

<div class="uk-alert uk-alert-danger">Note: Please be careful when selecting allowed groups! You should never need to offer users the option of becoming an <em>Administrator</em> or <em>Super Administrator</em> while registering.</div>
