## <a name="mod-guide"></a>Module Guide

The **CoalaWeb News** module has a huge list of options so we have broken them up into several sections which are explained in detail below.

### <a name="mod-general"></a>General Options

To make it easy to explain I have broken this section up into four parts.

**Part 1 Categories**

The first option you have in this section allows you to choose which categories you want to use as the source for your displayed articles. *\[Figure-1a\]*

The second option allows you to display a linkable list of categories that coincides with the current articles being displayed. *\[Figure-1b\]*

**Part 2 Articles**

The first options allows you to turn on or off the display of an article title. Next you have the option of making the title a link to the associated article or not. With the next option you can select a style for the article title. 

In the next input field you can enter a number for the maximum amount of articles you wish to be displayed. The next option allows you to control the maximum characters that will be displayed for each article. The last two options affect the ordering of the articles. *\[Figure-2\]*

**Part 3 Read More**

In this section we have some options to control if and how a read more link or button are displayed. The first option is to turn on or off the display of a read more link. The second option control what text will be used for the link or on the button. 

The next couple of options depends on what version you are using, for the Core users you only have a link option available. For the Pro users you have the following options:

-   Button Primary
-   Button Success
-   Button Danger
-   Just Link

These option are controlled by UIkit but if you would like to use your own CSS class you can chose **Custom** for the **Type** and then enter the CSS class in the next field labeled **Custom Button** for example. *\[Figure-3\]*

>   btn btn-primary
